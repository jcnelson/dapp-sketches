# The Myth of the Scalable Sybil-resistent Peer Network

This is a rant I need to get off my chest on the design of certain pieces of
dapp infrastructure out there.  The key take-aways are that **DHTs are a comforting
lie** and **public blockchains do not scale**.
DHTs are not reliable and they're easy to attack.  Don't use them, don't
build on them, and don't trust projects that do so.  Also, public blockchains that
resist Sybils will never scale -- they only have finite capacity, no matter how
many nodes you throw at them.  If someone tells you they have a scalable public
blockchain, they're lying to you and may be trying to fleece you.

## The Sybil Attack

Lots of decentralized infrastructure projects rely on open-membership DHTs in some way
-- in particular, the Kademlia DHT.  Examples include IPFS, cjdns, Storj,
Dat, Ethereum, and BitTorrent.  The trouble is that DHTs, like all scalable
open-membership peer networks, are easy to attack with Sybils.

How do you attack an open-membership peer network like a DHT?
In his seminal paper [The Sybil
Attack](https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/sybil.pdf) (2002), John
Douceur shows that in the absence of very expensive
countermeasures in the peer network, **a single faulty node can simulate an unbound number of
faulty nodes in the network**.  In the context of DHTs, this means a single peer
can both take over arbitrary hash buckets in the DHT, and pollute arbitrarily
many routing table entries.  This would let a single malicious peer do things like:

* Censor or equivocate about arbitrary key/value pairs.
* Split the peer network and eclipse victim nodes and clients.
* Force victims to contact specific nodes to route or resolve data (e.g. in
  order to spy on them).

There have been lots and lots of so-called "Sybil-proof" DHT systems presented
over the past 20 years, but none of them completely prevent these problems.
Instead, they either sacrifice the network's open-membership property,
or do various things to make attacks more expensive (but not by very much).

Douceur's proofs are not specific to DHTs, but apply to every open-membership
peer network.  I pick on DHTs specifically in this post because they're by far
the most commonly used scalable open-membership peer network.

## Preventing Sybils

The same paper by Douceur presents another key finding that is now common
knowledge among the blockchain community.  That finding is that the only way to prevent
a malicious node from simulating an unbound number of Sybils is to do the
following things:

* Make participation in the peer network expensive -- such as through spending a
  computing resource like CPU time, space, or network bandwidth.
* Require all nodes to verify that each other participating node spent the requisite resource,
  and do so concurrently, so as to force the attacker to prove that it committed
  resources.
* Periodically adjust the required resource expenditure to account for fluctuations in the
  amount of available resources.

The reason this works is because each node -- faulty or not -- has only finite
computing resources available.  By having all nodes validate each other
concurrently, the network places an upper bound on how many Sybils an attacker
can create -- the attacker doesn't have the resources to fool
every node at once.

Proof-of-work blockchains are a great example of this principle in practice.
Since nodes have to spend CPU cycles to participate, and since every node checks
that every other node has spent those cycles, a single faulty node cannot
overwhelm the network without also spending more CPU cycles than everyone else.

## Scalability or Sybil Resistence: Choose At Most One

Unfortunately for us network engineers, the fact that preventing 
sybils requires both spending a resource and concurrently verifying expenditures
means that **it is impossible to build a Sybil-resistent peer network that scales.**
Since each node in a Sybil-resistent peer network needs
to verify that each other node has "paid for" its participation, the amount of useful work the
network can do is rate-limited to that of its slowest peer.
Put another way, the network needs to throttle itself so that sufficiently many
peers can participate.

This brings me back to my opening remarks:  **DHTs are a comforting lie** and
**public blockchains do not scale.**  If your peer network is designed to be scalable
-- that is, you can increase its capacity by throwing more resources at it -- then it
cannot resist Sybil attacks.  Conversely, your peer network is designed to resist Sybils, then
you cannot increase its capacity by adding more peers.
